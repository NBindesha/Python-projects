    "#### 1. Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.\n",
    "#### 2. Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.\n",
    "#### 3. Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses"
