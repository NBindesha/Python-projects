    "# Snake Water Gun game using Python\n",
    "##### Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, we are going to implement this game using python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Following are the rules of the game:\n",
    "##### Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.\n",
    "##### Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water\n",
    "##### Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.\n",
    "##### In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw."
